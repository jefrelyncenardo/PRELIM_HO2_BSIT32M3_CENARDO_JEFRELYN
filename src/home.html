              Hi! I'm <strong>Jefrelyn E. Cenardo</strong>.<br /><br />
              I am a student of
              <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</strong> at
              <strong>LYCEUM of ALABANG</strong>. Creating, coding, designing,
              and solving problems are the things I enjoy the most. I am an
              optimistic person, and I love learning new things.<br /><br />
              During my college days, I was a working student. As a dedicated
              individual, I always ensure that I perform my duties and
              responsibilities well, and I make sure to submit my projects and
              requirements on time.<br /><br />
